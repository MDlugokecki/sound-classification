# sound-classification

I have made those notebooks to show what I have learnt in machine learning so far.
The machine learning task is to classify sounds into one of ten predefined classes. The data is labeled so this is a supervised classification task.
I have used UrbanSound8K dataset which is available on the Kaggle web site (www.kaggle.com). Detailed information about the dataset can be found in a notebook with 'Part 1' in its name. More about what have been done can be found in notebook called 'Introduction'.

# TODO
There are still some things that I plan to complete.
1. Part 6 - try FFN and CNN using tensorflow
2. Add scoreboard for classifiers (from part 4 to part 6) for easier models comparisons.
3. Part 5 - tuning ensamble models.
